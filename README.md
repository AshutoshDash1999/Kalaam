<h2 align="center">Supporting Kalaam</h2>


## Introduction

Kalaam is the programming language in Hindi and has all the basic functionalities of a modern programming language. From for loops to while loops and from functions to conditional statements.

Kalaam has it's own parser, interpretor, Virtual memory stack and executes source code from parse tree generated by parser. 

Thank you to all the amazing developers who showed interest in contributing to the development of Kalaam. 

## Where is the compiler code?:

Visit 'src/lib/Compiler/main.js' in repo structure to access Kalaam compile engine and learn about how Kalaam works.

## To test kalaam.io locally

The setups for recreating the project have been given in the [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) file.

## Contributions

- You can work on either Frontend, Backend or Documentation, whatever you think you can be best at with your current level of experiance.
- This is a complete Kalaam.io application. The compiler is availible as a standalone npm package called Kalaam-core.
- Fork the repo by selecting the branch you want to work on.
- Feel absolutely free to play with frontend or backend. Creative ideas are most welcome.
- Use Kalaam Discord sever to connect with fellow contributers.

## Future plans

- Right now, Kalaam is in it's early stage. Many programming languges took decades of team work to reach their God level
- Kalaam needs to have a usecase so that people can start building stuff with it like apps, websites, extensions, plugins etc.
- Sooner or later, we need a faster compilation process. That means Kalaam-compiler will have to be written in low level languages like c/c++.
