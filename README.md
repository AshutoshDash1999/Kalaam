## Introduction

Kalaam is the programming language in Hindi and has all the basic functionalities of a modern programming language. From for loops to while loops and from functions to conditional statements.

Kalaam has it's own parser, interpretor, Virtual memory stack and executes source code from parse tree generated by parser. 

Thank you to all the amazing developers who showed interest in contributing to the development of Kalaam.

- Feel absolutely free to play with frontend or backend. Creative ideas are most welcome.
- Use Kalaam Discord sever to connect with fellow contributers.

## Future plans

- Right now, Kalaam is in it's early stage. Many programming languges took decades of team work to reach their God level. We go step by step.
- Kalaam needs to have a usecase so that people can start building stuff with it like apps, websites, extensions, plugins. The usecase can be unique 
that suits well to the indian ecosystem. This will help us to move in a straight direction.
- Conside Kalaam as your own project, explore it and feel free to try out new ideas.


## Documentation

To check out documentation visit [Documentation](https://www.kalaam.io/documentation).

- Documentation needs a lot of work. I think short video tuts will really help insated of just overload of texts.


## Examples

To check out examples visit [live examples](https://www.kalaam.io/examples).

Feel free to add more examples. We have three categories for examples. Basic, Intermediate and advanced. Add according to conext.
